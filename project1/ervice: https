> FIREWALLD    (/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/modules/system/firewalld.py)

        This module allows for addition or deletion of services and ports either tcp or udp in either running or permanent firewalld
        rules.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- immediate
        Should this configuration be applied immediately, if set as permanent
        [Default: False]
        version_added: 1.9

- interface
        The interface you would like to add/remove to/from a zone in firewalld
        [Default: None]
        version_added: 2.1

- masquerade
        The masquerade setting you would like to enable/disable to/from zones within firewalld
        [Default: None]
        version_added: 2.1

- permanent
        Should this configuration be in the running firewalld configuration or persist across reboots. As of Ansible version 2.3,
        permanent operations can operate on firewalld configs when it's not running (requires firewalld >= 3.0.9). (NOTE: If this is
        false, immediate is assumed true.)
        [Default: None]

- port
        Name of a port or port range to add/remove to/from firewalld. Must be in the form PORT/PROTOCOL or PORT-PORT/PROTOCOL for port
        ranges.
        [Default: None]

- rich_rule
        Rich rule to add/remove to/from firewalld.
        [Default: None]

- service
        Name of a service to add/remove to/from firewalld - service must be listed in output of firewall-cmd --get-services.
        [Default: None]

- source
        The source/network you would like to add/remove to/from firewalld
        [Default: None]
        version_added: 2.0

= state
        Should this port accept(enabled) or reject(disabled) connections.
        (Choices: enabled, disabled)

- timeout
        The amount of time the rule should be in effect for when non-permanent.
        [Default: 0]

- zone
        The firewalld zone to add/remove to/from (NOTE: default zone can be configured per system but "public" is default from
        upstream. Available choices can be extended based on per-system configs, listed here are "out of the box" defaults).
        (Choices: work, drop, internal, external, trusted, home, dmz, public, block)[Default: system-default(public)]


NOTES:
      * Not tested on any Debian based system.
      * Requires the python2 bindings of firewalld, which may not be installed by default if the distribution switched to python
